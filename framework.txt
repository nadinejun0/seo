# Etsy Listing Optimization Score Framework

This document outlines the scoring criteria used in the Etsy Listing Score Tester, which evaluates product listings based on three main categories: Title, Tags, and Description. Each category has a maximum score of 4 points.

## Overall Score Calculation
- Title: 40% of total score
- Tags: 40% of total score
- Description: 20% of total score

Grades are assigned as follows:
- A: 3.5 to 4.0
- B: 2.5 to 3.4
- C: 1.5 to 2.4
- D: Below 1.5

## Interdependence of Scoring Elements

While each category is scored separately, several scoring components depend on the relationship between different elements:

1. **Title and Tags Connection:**
   - Focus Keywords (part of the Title score) are tags that appear in the first 60 characters of the title
   - Without tags, a title cannot earn focus keyword points (up to 1.2 points lost)
   - Tags must be entered before analyzing to get an accurate title score

2. **Description and Title Connection:**
   - Keyword Integration (part of the Description score) measures title keywords in the description
   - Without a title, a description cannot earn keyword integration points (up to 1.6 points lost)
   - Title must be entered before analyzing to get an accurate description score

3. **Practical Implications:**
   - Enter all three elements (title, tags, description) before analyzing for accurate scores
   - Optimize elements together rather than in isolation
   - This interdependence reflects how Etsy's actual search algorithm evaluates listings
   - Consistency in keyword usage across all elements is rewarded

## Title Scoring (4 points max)

### 1. Character Count (1.2 points)
- Optimal (1.2 points): 70-140 characters
- Acceptable (0.6 points): 50-69 characters
- Poor (0.3 points): Less than 50 or more than 140 characters

### 2. Focus Keywords in First 60 Characters (1.2 points)
- Each tag keyword found in the first 60 characters: 0.3 points (up to 1.2 points)
- First 60 characters are critical for search visibility

### 3. Keyword Redundancy (0.8 points)
- No words repeated more than twice (0.8 points)
- Any word repeated 3+ times results in 0 points for this category
- This is an all-or-nothing score with no partial credit

### 4. Structural Elements - Commas (0.8 points)
- Optimal (0.8 points): 2-6 commas to separate keywords
- Acceptable (0.4 points): 1 comma
- Poor (0.2 points): No commas or too many commas (6+)

## Tags Scoring (4 points max)

### 1. Tag Count (1.0 point)
- Score is calculated as: (number of tags ÷ 13) × 1.0
- Using all 13 available tags gives maximum points

### 2. Multi-word Tag Ratio (1.0 point)
- Score equals the ratio of multi-word tags to total tags
- Higher percentage of multi-word tags receives better scores
- Multi-word tags are more specific and targeted

### 3. Tag Quality (1.0 point)
- Low quality tags: less than 10 characters AND fewer than 3 words
- No low quality tags (1.0 point)
- Any low quality tags (0.0 points)
- This is an all-or-nothing score with no partial credit

### 4. Tag Diversity (1.0 point)
- Measures unique words across all tags
- Excellent (1.0 point): 80%+ unique words
- Good (0.75 point): 60-79% unique words
- Fair (0.5 point): 40-59% unique words
- Poor (0.25 point): Less than 40% unique words

## Description Scoring (4 points max)

### 1. Length and Detail (1.2 points)
- Optimal (1.2 points): 160+ characters
- Good (0.9 points): 100-159 characters
- Fair (0.6 points): 50-99 characters
- Poor (0.3 points): Less than 50 characters

### 2. Structural Formatting (1.2 points)
- List elements (1.2 points): Presence of bulleted or numbered lists (•, *, -, 1.)
- This is an all-or-nothing score: full points if list elements are present, zero if not
- Paragraph breaks and text formatting are tracked but do not affect the score

### 3. Keyword Integration (1.6 points)
- Score calculated as: (keywords from title found in description ÷ total keywords in title) × 1.6
- Higher percentage of title keywords appearing in description gets better score
- Maximum of 1.6 points
- Found keywords are highlighted in purple pills, missing keywords in gray pills
- Only words with 3+ characters from title are considered as keywords
